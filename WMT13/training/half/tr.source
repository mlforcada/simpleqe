In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped to shield the poor.
Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995, it tracks changes in attitude across the region.
The first is Latin America's fairly sunny mood.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region.
But the United States is seen as the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Some 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed, up from 47% last year.
That is scarcer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
Observers from the Organisation of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they did "not believe these irregularities, serious as they were, necessarily invalidated the process."
Many Haitians, including lots displaced by January's earthquake, roamed around trying to find out where to vote.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations' top official in Haiti, declared it "a fairly good election in many ways."
And so, it is clear, do Haitians themselves.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was scarred by economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation, his priorities.
But the opposition is divided, and it was thrown further into disarray by Mr Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27th.
The economy is overheating wildly: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
Tiptoeing to the centre
The Kirchners always insisted this could not involve oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
She has called for talks between private business and union leaders.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 2002.
Certainly, it would like to see political integration too, but first things first.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and youths.
It even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
The election saw most of the staples of Taiwanese elections, including rowdy campaign trucks and flag-waving mass rallies with skimpily clad dancing girls.
He even ordered Mr Su, a pragmatist, not to run for the presidency.
Mr Chen seems infuriated by the shift.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation that his China policy is acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
Even without Mr Chen's interference, the DPP will struggle to choose between its potential candidates.
Perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was China.
Taiwan's voters are inching towards a kind of closer union with the mainland.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
The DPP's strong showing suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
Mr Ma himself has become a surrogate for feelings about the mainland, having forged groundbreaking business links, including a partial free-trade pact, in the biggest rearrangement of relations with China proper since 1949.
That comes after the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supply.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's call, and expressed support for it.
It is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups, who have banked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sand Hills region and Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to TransCanada.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle but got no response.

She said Genevieve got hysterical.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward, and given her airily inviting vocal style and a deft hand with pop, funk and Latin influences, it's possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding from Norah Jones' runaway success in 2003, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters looking toward jazz's neighborhood in this category in recent years.
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise tilts heavily toward fusion with nods toward albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Composers who are up for Grammys for contemporary composition include PÃ¤rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."

"It's a paper tiger, an Army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
That list included the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Marines need to replace the humvee.
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness."
"The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
The Pentagon already is digesting $450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he came to the top Pentagon job with years of budget expertise himself in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was facing tough choices.
"It's a ship without sailors."
Deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story, they might point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit "post-interview relief" -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over.
It helps provide a reference point for measuring changes later.
Then look for clusters of deceptive verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
A glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife.
And then again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus President Bill Clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
New York congressman and Internet flasher Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible evidence.
You'd better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you don't make unjust accusations when you see foot-tapping in the middle of the meeting.

Mexico president's sister apparently defeated in Michoacan vote
"The intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not just for Michoacan but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
It is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they're not moving at any faster pace than in past years.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms members of Congress can serve, while Rep. JosÃ© E. Serrano (D-N.Y.) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Will the new measure earn the full support of the Foreign Relations panel, or will it split lawmakers like the June bill did?
That left the U.S. mission in a form of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission but not so angry as to actually pull the rug out from under it.
The Budget Control Act, which passed in August, required that both the House and Senate vote on a balanced budget amendment.
The language may sound innocuous, but nothing about the Libya debate has been easy so far.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet.
Other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their amendments to the floor, but not for lack of trying.
Across the Capitol, the House is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority of nearly every congressional Republican and some Democrats.
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
In videos shot by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constituent event in Tucson, Rep. Gabrielle Gifffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway show tune "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to Congress.
"The servicemen and women were regarded as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.

Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
The black-tie crowd rose to its feet and cheered.
They also realize that the anger that returning troops faced in the latter years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
Others would wonder whether there was an "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a senior government job in Washington.
After his two sons returned from combat tours with the Marines, retired Col. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two perspectives.

Arsenic-tolerant microbe raises possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere
Arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other.
"This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
"That makes it very peculiar, though it falls short of being some form of truly 'alien' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science.
"It makes you wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
It didn't.

After several months of discussions, the parties agreed in late 2009 to put the company up for sale.
It is currently being syndicated by the investment bank - which is itself kicking in $75 million - and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
A New York federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to wipe out about $5 billion in debt, clearing the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and television shows.

The starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring American public.
"We have kept highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons-grade and lower-enriched uranium," Lukashenko said then.
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, however, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
"Welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations, and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," it said.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusan research facility.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.

But inflation has eroded the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 2002.
Earlier this year the government struck a deal with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which Argentina defaulted in 2001.

The Kirchners always insisted this could not involve oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
By the time Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
But after chaotic sessions (in which a parliamentarian punched another in the face, and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was scarred by economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation, his priorities.
The KMT is due for soul-searching of its own.

The DPP's strong showing suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
His unpopularity seems to be owing largely to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
Two years ago it was at a low point: its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to jail on charges of corruption.
Better to wait till after the 2012 presidential election for that.
Either way, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the shooting affected the election, casting suspicion on the DPP and driving voters towards the KMT.
But under the leadership of Ms Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and youths.
It even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination attempt.
For the first time, the DPP drew even with the KMT in the city councils.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has leant towards fuller independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes to the KMT's 45%.

Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise pick in best new artist category
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward, and given her airily inviting vocal style and a deft hand with pop, funk and Latin influences, it's possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding from Norah Jones' runaway success in 2003, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters looking toward jazz's neighborhood in this category in recent years.
Trombone Shorty, a raucous New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise tilts heavily toward fusion with nods toward albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Vocal-soloist nominees were all female this year and included Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia DuchonovÃ¡, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
The L.A. composer said that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performed the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
Composers who are up for Grammys for contemporary composition include PÃ¤rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo PÃ¤rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a piece that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
A category for classical producer of the year features five nominees - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Troops feel more pity than respect

The Pentagon already is digesting $450 billion of reductions over the next decade but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if Congress cannot reach a deal on spending.
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"We are staunchly opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"The sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to occur."
At a news conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core.
"These changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness."
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate manner, would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
The two senators had written Panetta 10 days ago, asking for details of the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
"It's a paper tiger, an Army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
Liars do look you in the eye.
I spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
A glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Someone might use lots of "qualifying language" when answering a hard question: " Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge."
Deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story, they might point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit "post-interview relief" -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Far from being a parlor game similar to, say, charades, where the object is to exclaim, "Gotcha," deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
How much deceit do we encounter?
Tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife.
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilt in lying to you.
But it is staging a comeback, and victory in Michoacan is an important step in that effort.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of Michoacan during violent state elections, and she alleged Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Mexico president's sister apparently defeated in Michoacan vote
Vallejo appears to have only narrowly edged out Calderon, who had led polls before election day.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which currently holds the governorship, came in third, a bad defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied ties to drug traffickers and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for Luisa Maria Calderon, and numerous candidates quit local races out of fear.
